Reply to the referee report on *Forty-eight hours with the Kourovka Notebook*

17 September 2026

Thank you for the detailed report and, especially, for independently rebuilding
the finite examples and re-deriving the carpet certificates. The checks and
the distinctions between mathematical validity, statement coverage, and
priority are useful. We agree that the paper should make its scope and
dependencies easier to assess. Below we clarify several points and describe
proposed revisions; these revisions have not yet been incorporated into the
manuscript.

1. **Repository and certificates.** Josef Urban will publish the full
   repository and send you the link. The frozen experimental revision is
   `cff2c37b9bf6b737e8ad5f7ead12291a551b5201`; subsequent manuscript work is
   separate from that snapshot.

   The complete certificates for 19.61 and 19.62, their inputs, and their
   checkers already accompany the manuscript source. They are under
   `paper/ancillary/` in the repository and under `anc/` in
   `paper/dist/kourovka-experiment-arxiv-source.tar.gz`. The README gives the
   checking commands. We inspected the archive and confirmed that these
   files are included. Your report indicates that the source bundle was not
   supplied with the PDF; we agree that the review materials should include
   it explicitly. The larger 20.100 certificate belongs to the research
   archive and requires separate handling. Public access will make it
   available for examination, but will not itself constitute a fresh
   verification.

2. **Problem 16.28(a).** The objection concerning algebraic closedness appears
   to overlook the bar in the first line of C.4. The field used there is
   `K = algebraic closure of F_5(t)`, not `F_5(t)` or the algebraic closure
   of `F_5`. It is algebraically closed, and its transcendental element `t`
   has infinite multiplicative order. The construction therefore does meet
   the usual algebraically closed-field convention. It uses a reducible
   closed set and a field not algebraic over a finite field; the printed
   question excludes neither. We would consequently not classify this
   entry as failing the algebraically closed-field reading.

   We will also check the field restrictions when clarifying part (b).
   The suggestion that the identical class works over any field needs
   qualification: in characteristic two, for example, the argument that
   its square omits `-I` no longer applies.

3. **Problem 14.72.** We agree that the distinction between a smooth effective
   Cartier divisor and a globally principal divisor should be made explicit.
   There is, however, a further distinction between a set-theoretic equation
   and a scheme-theoretic equation. In the displayed surface, `x = 0` forces
   `y = u = 0`, so it already cuts out the fixed locus set-theoretically.
   On the chart containing that locus, `x = y^2/(x^2 - 1)`: this equation
   defines twice the fixed divisor, rather than its reduced scheme.

   Thus the issue is whether “regular hypersurface” requires the reduced
   fixed divisor itself to have a single global defining equation. The
   current proof establishes the smooth Cartier-divisor reading. We propose
   clarifying this and investigating the suggested strengthening to the
   globally principal reading. A construction over the complex numbers is
   sufficient to disprove the unrestricted assertion over fields of arbitrary
   characteristic; treating the wild case would be a further result.

4. **Problem 21.106 and priority.** Thank you for identifying the related
   Heisenberg construction and Lean formalisation. We checked the
   [repository](https://github.com/TPColor/kourovka-notebook-problem-21.106),
   which credits Lily Zhang with the original counterexample and proof and
   Evan Li with the Heisenberg simplification. This work should be acknowledged
   in the discussion of Theorem 4.1.

   Our local proof file was first committed on 10 September at 21:05:23 UTC.
   The other repository's initial README contained only its title; the
   [commit adding the Lean files](https://github.com/TPColor/kourovka-notebook-problem-21.106/commit/f32b72719e07)
   is dated 11 September at 10:54:21 UTC. These are facts about the recorded
   artifacts, not proof of discovery priority. We therefore would not adopt
   the report's stronger conclusion that the agent was first. We propose
   reporting the chronology and acknowledging the contemporaneous work
   without assigning priority.

   The exact repository URL does not occur in the supplied session JSONL.
   This limited check does not establish the absence of exposure through
   another source. The JSONL retains web queries, actions, and results, from
   which a dated source-access index can be prepared. Such an index should
   distinguish recorded retrieval from evidence that a source was actually
   used in an argument.

5. **The ledger and intended readings.** We agree that scope and conventions
   should be visible in the inventory. We suggest separate fields for covered
   parts, convention-sensitive hypotheses, prior-work status, and imported
   dependencies. The 46-entry deadline ledger is a historical record; a
   subsequent assessment can supplement it without altering what was
   classified at the deadline. Likewise, the complete answers and deductions
   in Appendix E can be made more visible while retaining their prior-work
   classification.

   We would avoid labeling approximately seven entries as answers the
   proposers probably did not intend without firmer evidence. The objection
   to 16.28 above does not apply. For 12.40, showing that no finite-valued
   bound of the requested form exists is a direct negative answer to the
   printed request. For 18.92 and 14.22, the stated definitions and hypotheses
   permit the constructions, although identifying any intended additional
   restrictions would be valuable. We agree that 16.20's convention and the
   scope of its alternative construction should be especially clear.

   Proof length, discovery difficulty, and novelty should also remain
   separate. A short proof or a rapidly completed formalisation does not by
   itself establish that the question was easy or was misread.

6. **Dependencies and choice of examples.** We agree that the finite input
   used for 15.92 should be easier to inspect. C.28 already states the required
   cycle and parity properties and points to Chapter 5, pages 117–120 of
   Conder's thesis; exposing the relevant finite construction data would
   strengthen that presentation. The scale and prescribed-relation steps
   used in 10.62/4.75 also merit a more explicit parameter justification tied
   to the exact source version.

   Promoting 19.56 is a useful suggestion. Its adaptation to coprime
   prime-power inputs gives a substantial example of the work performed.
   Its exposition should retain the imported hyperfocal theorem,
   minimal-simple structure, and Baer–Suzuki theorem rather than describe
   the proof as self-contained without qualification.

7. **Smaller corrections and review records.** We will check the cited
   equation/theorem numbers, the exponential-group reference, the
   characteristic assumptions in C.4, and the character-table version;
   clarify the CA/CN terminology; and make the one-cent rounding difference
   explicit. These are useful presentation and attribution checks rather
   than grounds for changing the exact usage totals.

   Please also send `review-other1/checks/` and `notes_progress.md`, which
   were not included with the copy of the report we received. They will let
   us preserve the external checks with their exact inputs, implementations,
   and outcomes. We will distinguish these later checks from the historical
   statement that there were no outside reviews at the research deadline.
