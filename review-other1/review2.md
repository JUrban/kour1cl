# Response to the authors' reply

17 September 2026. This responds to `review1-reply/reply.md`, records corrections to my first report, and reports a
second round of checking made possible by the material the authors supplied and by the now-public repository
`github.com/JUrban/kour1`. Scripts and logs for this round are in `review-other1/checks2/`; the first round is in
`review-other1/checks/` and `review-other1/review.md`.

## 1. Corrections to my report

**Problem 16.28(a): my objection was wrong, and I withdraw it.** The authors are right. Section C.4 sets
K equal to the algebraic closure of the rational function field in one variable over the field of five elements, and
I rendered a page image to confirm the bar is there. My text extraction dropped it, and I built a criticism on the
result without checking the typeset page. That field is algebraically closed, so the example meets the usual
convention for a connected reductive algebraic group, and its transcendental element still has infinite
multiplicative order, which is all the argument needs. Nothing in the entry depends on a non-closed field. Please
delete that bullet from Section 6 of my report; I have marked it retracted there.

A second error of mine follows from the same place. In Section 8 I suggested the paper should say that part (b)
holds for the same conjugacy class over any field. The authors' qualification is correct: in characteristic two the
step that the square omits minus the identity collapses, since minus the identity is the identity and the trace
condition no longer separates. The suggestion should read "over any field of odd characteristic", if it is made at
all.

**The count of convention-sensitive entries.** I withdraw the figure of roughly seven entries, and with it the
phrase about readings the proposer probably did not intend. Two of my examples do not survive: 16.28 for the reason
above, and 12.40, where showing that no finite-valued bound of the requested shape exists is a direct negative
answer to the printed request, as the authors say. What I should have written is narrower and I still hold it. Three
entries turn on a stated convention that a reader must notice to judge the result: 18.92 on the printed definition of
a complete lattice of formations, 14.22 on the coefficient group not being finitely generated, and 16.20 on whether
the ambient group must lie in the quasivariety whose dominions are taken. Naming the convention in the entry is
enough; speculating about intent was not my business.

**Proof length.** I accept the point. A short proof, or a formalisation completed quickly by others, says nothing
about how hard the question was or whether it was misread. My recommendation should be read only as asking that the
reader be told which entries are short, because a bare count of 46 invites the opposite assumption.

**Problem 21.106.** I adopt the authors' formulation. The artifact record shows their proof file committed on
10 September at 21:05:23 UTC and the Lean files pushed on 11 September at 10:54:21 UTC, and artifact times are not
discovery times. My report should not have said the agent was first, only that this is the recorded order. I also
cannot check their statement that the repository URL is absent from the session record: no session log is public.
The repository's `state/session.json` is 155 bytes and no rollout file appears anywhere in the tree.

## 2. Where I hold the position, with one refinement

**Problem 14.72.** We agree on the mathematics and the authors have sharpened it. Their observation is the right
one: the function x vanishes on the fixed locus to order two, so it cuts out twice the fixed divisor, not its
reduced scheme. In divisor-class terms the class of the reduced fixed divisor is a nonzero two-torsion class, which
is exactly why twice it is principal while it is not. So the entry establishes the smooth Cartier-divisor reading
and leaves the globally principal reading open, and the distinction between a set-theoretic equation, a
scheme-theoretic equation for twice the divisor, and a global equation for the reduced divisor is worth one
sentence in the paper. The repair I suggested still looks available: deleting a suitable orbit of four-torsion
fibres kills the class while keeping both the fixed divisor and the singular quotient point.

**The remaining archive gap is small and concrete.** Three of the four ancillary scripts run and pass here, and
those three are the ones the README documents. The fourth, `verify_19_62_monomial_certificates.py`, aborts
immediately because `results/19.62-g2-monomial-certificates.jsonl` is not in the bundle. It is absent from the
supplied directory, from the thirty entries under `anc/` in the arXiv tarball, and from the twenty-eight entries
under `ancillary/` in the full-source zip; neither archive contains any file whose name matches
"monomial-certificates". Either ship the data or drop the script.

**Problem 20.100.** Unchanged, and I read the authors as agreeing. The public repository holds 88 files for this
problem totalling 7.5 megabytes. The n = 7 certificate is not among them; the largest file is the n = 6 certificate
at 6.4 megabytes. What is public is the generator log, which records the certificate's digest, and the shard
verifier logs, which record their PASS lines. The claim is therefore documented but not independently checkable,
which is what the paper already says.

**Problem 15.92.** I downgrade my flag rather than withdraw it. The data is now inspectable, and I checked it. See
the next section: the choice of prime is forced by the transcribed cycle structures, not arbitrary. What the paper
should add is one clause saying so, because as printed the assignment of 11 or 13 to residue classes looks like an
unexplained stipulation.

## 3. Second round of verification

Everything below is new since my first report.

- **The carpet certificates now check out from the supplied bundle as well as from my own re-derivation.** The three
  documented commands pass: rank-two certificates for the three rank-two types with 6, 20 and 78 targets;
  square-completion certificates with 12, 48 and 240 targets and 72, 380 and 2,739 nodes; and the integer-constant
  check reporting 156 rule entries for the exceptional rank-two type. Every one of those counts agrees with what I
  computed independently in the first round, including the 156 rule entries, which I had obtained from a Chevalley
  basis without seeing their table.
- **Problem 21.114 is now verified.** Working from the archive's own permutation models, GAP confirms both retained
  models have order 512 with derived series orders 512, 32, 2, 1, centre cyclic of order four with a unique cyclic
  central subgroup of that order, quotient of order 128 whose abelianisation has order 16, that quotient weakly
  ab-maximal, and derived length three. These were the numbers I could not check from the paper.
- **Problem 15.92 is largely resolved.** The archive's two replay scripts run here: the cycle controls finish with
  their sentinel over 150 rows, and the diagram reconstruction completes under GAP with exit code zero. I then
  checked their receipt myself: in all 150 rows the chosen prime occurs exactly once as a cycle length, no other
  cycle length is divisible by it, every length divides 720720, and dividing that number by the prime kills every
  other cycle. The prime is 11 exactly for the residue classes 7, 8, 11 and 13 exactly for 9, 10, 12. The thesis
  itself is in the archive with its page images, and its digest matches the receipt.
- **The ledger matches the paper.** The frozen ledger records 46 candidates, zero outside reviews, priority
  unestablished on every entry, and the same problems in the same order as Appendix B.
- **The handoff is internally consistent.** The two archives and the PDF match the supplied manifest and validation
  digests, and the PDF I reviewed is the one they validated.

## 4. On the authors' requests

The external checks are already committed. They are on branch `review/kourovka-other1`, commit `2b5bfe4`, in
`review-other1/checks/` with `review-other1/notes_progress.md`; this round adds `review-other1/checks2/`. Each log
names the entry it belongs to, and the index at the end of the working notes maps logs to entries. I agree these are
later external checks and not part of the deadline record, and that they do not change the historical statement that
there were no outside reviews at the deadline.

## 5. Revised judgement

Unchanged in direction and slightly stronger. Accept after revision. The mathematical picture is better than at my
first pass: three items I had recorded as unverifiable are now verified, one criticism of mine was wrong and is
withdrawn, and the remaining defects are editorial. The revisions I would still ask for are the convention fields in
the ledger, the one missing certificate file, the clause explaining the choice of prime in 15.92, the reduced versus
non-reduced distinction in 14.72, and the acknowledgement of the contemporaneous work on 21.106.
